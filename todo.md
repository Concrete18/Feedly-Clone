TODO When initially creating an account, users don't have much guidance after being logged in, and if they have never used Feedly before then they might be a bit lost.
I would consider adding something to prompt the user to create their first feed, maybe even suggesting one or two RSS feed links they can use to try it out.
TODO Consider prompting the user to add a new source immediately after adding a new feed. Alternatively, you could create a "help" button somewhere on the page that gives more guidance
TODO The "keep unread" and "save" buttons are hard to notice, it took me a few minutes to figure out how to add articles to "Read Later"
TODO Would it be possible to convert the splash page image into live articles? As it is now, it looks amazing but gives the impression you can interact with the links.
If you can't make these live links, maybe consider adding some styling that gives the impression this is a screenshot of the functionality, or prompt the user to login if they click on the image.
